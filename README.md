# Python-Challenge
For the Python challege, i started off with PyBank first.  I was able to take the CSV file and create two lists from the csv file.  One list contained the Months and the other list contains the Profit/Loss.  Usin the length function, i was able to determine the number of entrys for the total number of months.  From the Profit/loss list, i created a new list (difference) with the difference from the current value from the previous value. found the total using the profit/lost list sum, the avaerage using the sum of the difference and dividing by the total months, and the max and min using the diffent list. With the max/min. i used .index to find the index for the max/min values and with the index was able to find the month/year from the month list corrisponding to the found array.

Next was PyPoll. When running through the csv file, i created two lists; one for voter Id and one for the Candidate name.  I used lenght function on the voter id to find the total number of votes casted.  I created a dictionary that added each candidate from the list and counted how many times each was in the list.  i was able to pull the key from the dictionary that received the most votes or times in the dictionary.  This was used to find the winner.  I created a loop that stated each key in the dictionary, the value for each key and that value divided by the total number of vates casted.
